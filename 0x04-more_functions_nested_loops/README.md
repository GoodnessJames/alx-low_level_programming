# Project Title: 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

## Overview
This is the continuation of the project - [0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/GoodnessJames/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops). The main **objective** of this project is to deepen our understanding and establish a solid foundation in the topic - **functions and nested loops.**

This project aims to provide more insight into the concept and usage of functions and nested loops within the C programming language. Functions are integral to organizing code, enhancing reusability, and improving code readability by breaking it down into smaller, modular components.

Furthermore, this project also presents more tasks on nested loops, which involve using loops within loops. Nested loops are particularly useful when dealing with complex patterns, iterative tasks, or multidimensional data structures.

## Description of each Program in the Tasks

## C-Program of Task 0

- Prints _putchar, followed by a new line (The program returns 0)

## C-Program of Task 1

Prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
-  _putchar was used ONLY twice in the code

## C-Program of Task 2

Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
-  _putchar was used ONLY twice in the code

## C-Program of Task 3

Checks for lowercase character
- Prototype: int _islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

## C-Program of Task 4

Checks for alphabetic character
- Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

## C-Program of Task 5

Prints the sign of a number.
- Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

## C-Program of Task 6

Computes the absolute value of an integer
- Prototype: int _abs(int);

## C-Program of Task 7

Prints the last digit of a number
- Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit

## Conclusion
By actively participating in this project, I enhanced my proficiency in implementing functions and utilizing nested loops effectively. This practical experience will contribute to my overall growth and competency in C programming, providing a solid foundation for future projects and endeavors.
