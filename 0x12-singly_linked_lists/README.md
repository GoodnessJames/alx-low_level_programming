# Project Title: Singly Linked List in C

## Overview

A singly linked list is a collection of heterogenous data elements in linear form stored in non-consecutive locations. This project covers the relevance of singly linked list compared to arrays, when and how to use and build a singly linked list. The following are terms used in this project topic:
- Node
- Head
- Tail
- Traverse

Building a singly linked list involves the following steps:
- Define a node template
- Allocate memory for the nodes declared
- Assign values to the nodes
- Assign address to the nodes
- Declare a temporary pointer to traverse the list
