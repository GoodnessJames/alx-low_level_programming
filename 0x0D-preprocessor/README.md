# Project Title: 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This project is centered on the following points:
- Understanding the C program Compilation Process
- Object-like Macros
- Macro Arguments
- Pre Processor Directives in C
- The C Preprocessor
- Standard Predefined Macros
- include guard
- Common Predefined Macros

The following are the tasks carried out on this topic to help solidify the theoretical knowledge gained from the learning resources:

## Task 0

The file (0-object_like_macro.h) in this task creates a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

## Task 1

The file (1-pi.h) in this task creates a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

## Task 2

The file (2-main.c) in this task prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line using the standard library.

## Task 3

In this file (3-function_like_macro.h), a function-like macro ABS(x) is written that computes the absolute value of a number x.

## Task 4

In this file (4-sum.h), a function-like macro SUM(x, y) is written that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
