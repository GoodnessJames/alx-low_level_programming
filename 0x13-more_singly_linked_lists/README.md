# Project Title: 0x13. C - More Singly linked lists

## Overview

This project is the continuation of project - [0x12. C - Singly linked lists](https://github.com/GoodnessJames/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists). This project involves further node operations on a linked list such as: 
	- Insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of a linked list
	- Deletion of a node from a linked list
	- Traversing a linked list to access or display elements

The time and space complexity of operations differs and depends on the operation being carried out. The time complexity refers to the amount of time required for an operation to carried out while space complexity refers to how much of memory space is required and how memory is utilized for a given operation.

It is also important to note that memory requirement and memory utiltization in a linked list differs from other data structures like arrays.

**Linked Lists VS Arrays (memory requirement and memory utiltization)**

**Memory Requirement:** In linked lists, the memory requirement is very high compared to arrays, due to memory is allocated to reference points of nodes. This is a drawback in linked lists. Arrays on the other hand have the advantage of less memory requirement for data structures because arrays only comprises of a data part that stores the data values contiguously without making any reference to the next data value.

**Memory Utilization:** In linked list, memory utilization is very efficient compared to arrays which have a drawback of fixed memory allocation to data sets that sometimes results in excess allocation or poor allocation of Memory.
