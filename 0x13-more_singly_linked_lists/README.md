# Project Title: Singly Linked List in C (0x13. C - More Singly linked lists)

## Overview

This project is the continuation of project - 0x12. C - Singly linked lists. This project involves further operations on a linked list such such: 
	- Insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of a linked list
	- Deletion of a node from a linked list
	- Traversing a linked list to access or display elements

The time and space complexity of operations differs and depends on the operation being carried out.

It is also important to note that memory requirement and memory utiltization in a linked list differs from other data structures like as arrays.

**Linked Lists VS Arrays (memory requirement and memory utiltization)**

**Memory Requirement:** In linked lists, the memory requirement is very high compared to arrays, due to a memory is allocated to reference points of nodes.

**Memory Utilization:** In linked list, memory utilization is very efficient compared to arrays which have a drawback of static memory allocation to data sets that sometimes results in excess allocation or poor allocation of Memory.
