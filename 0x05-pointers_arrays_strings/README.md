# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Description of each c-program file in the tasks

## Task 0: 0-reset_to_98.c

The function (reset_to_98) in this file takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

## Task 1: 1-swap.c

The function (swap_int) swaps the values of two integers.
- Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);


## Task 2: 2-strlen.c

The function (_strlen) returns the length of a string.
- Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

## Task 3: 3-puts.c

The function (_puts) prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
- Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

## Task 4: 4-print_rev.c

The function prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

## Task 5: 5-rev_string.c

The function (rev_string) reverses a string.
- Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

## Task 6: 6-puts2.c

The function (puts2) prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

## Task 7: 7-puts_half.c

The function (puts_half) prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
- The function prints the second half of the string
- If the number of characters is odd, the function prints the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

## Task 8: 8-print_array.c

The function (print_array) prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
- where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
- Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space
- The numbers are displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array

## Task 9: 9-strcpy.c

The function (*_strcpy) copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
- Return value: the pointer to dest
