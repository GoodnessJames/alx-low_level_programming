# Project Title: 0x03-debugging

## Introduction
Debugging in C is the process of detecting and fixing errors or bugs that occur within a C program. Bugs can cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect results, highlighting the significance of debugging as a vital skill for programmers who seek to ensure the correct execution of their code. To identify and resolve these issues, debugging involves the utilization of specialized techniques and tools. Syntax errors, logical errors, memory leaks, and segmentation faults are among the common types of bugs encountered in C programs.

## Description of each Program in the Tasks
Below is the description of each debugging task in the project:

### Task 0

- The file (0-main.c) created in this task tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

### Task 1

- Fixes the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

### C-Program of Task 2

- Fixes the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case

### C-Program of Task 3

- Fixes the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

## Conclusion
The debugging process is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of C programs, preventing unexpected behavior, crashes, and incorrect results. This project gave me a good understanding of how to master debugging skills, and with this,  I can create more robust and reliable code, enhancing the overall quality of my projects.
