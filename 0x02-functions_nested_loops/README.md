## Description of each Program in the Tasks

## C-Program of Task 0

- Prints _putchar, followed by a new line (The program returns 0)

## C-Program of Task 1

Prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
-  _putchar was used ONLY twice in the code

## C-Program of Task 2

Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
-  _putchar was used ONLY twice in the code

## C-Program of Task 3

Checks for lowercase character
- Prototype: int _islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

## C-Program of Task 4

Checks for alphabetic character
- Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

## C-Program of Task 5

Prints the sign of a number.
- Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

## C-Program of Task 6

Computes the absolute value of an integer
- Prototype: int _abs(int);

## C-Program of Task 7

Prints the last digit of a number
- Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit

## C-Program of Task 8

Prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
- Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

## C-Program of Task 9

Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
- Prototype: void times_table(void);

## C-Program of Task 10

Adds two integers and returns the result
- Prototype: int add(int, int);

## C-Program of Task 11

Prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line
- Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
- Numbers are separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Numbers are printed in order
- The first printed number is the number passed to your function
- The last printed number is 98
- The standard library is not used
