# Project Title: 0x01-variables_if_else_while

## Introduction
Variables, if, else statements, and while loops are fundamental constructs in C programming that enables the performance of decision-making and repetitive tasks based on specific conditions. Understanding and effectively using variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops are crucial for developing complex and flexible programs in C.
- **Variables:** Variables in C are used to store and manipulate data. They are named memory locations that hold values of a specific type, such as integers, characters, or floating-point numbers. Before using a variable, you need to declare it by specifying its data type and name. Variables can be assigned values and their contents can be modified throughout the program.
- **if statement:** The if statement is a control structure in C used for conditional execution. It allows you to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code based on a certain condition.

The syntax of an if statement is as follows:

```
if (condition) { 
/* code to be executed if the condition is true */
} 
```
If the condition inside the parentheses evaluates to true, the code block enclosed in curly braces will be executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

- **else statement:** The else statement is used in conjunction with the if statement to provide an alternative block of code to be executed when the if condition is false. 

The syntax is as follows: 
```
if (condition) {
 /* code to be executed if the condition is true
} 
else { 
/* code to be executed if the condition is false */
} 
```
If the condition in the if statement is true, the code block inside the if block is executed. If the condition is false, the code block inside the else block is executed.

- **while loop:** The while loop is a control structure that allows repeated execution of a block of code as long as a condition is true. 

The syntax of a while loop is as follows: 
```
while (condition) {
 /* code to be executed while the condition is true */
}
```
The code block inside the while loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition inside the parentheses evaluates to true. If the condition becomes false, the loop is exited, and the program continues to the next statement after the loop.


## Description of each Program in the Tasks

### C-Program of Task 0

- Prints a postitive number, negative number or zero

### C-Program of Task 1

-  Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n

### C-Program of Task 2

- Prints alphabets in lowercase, followed by a new line using the putchar function

### C-Program of Task 3

- Prints alphabets in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using the putchar fuction

### C-Program of Task 4

- Print all the letters except q and e using the putchar function

### C-Program of Task 5

- Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line

### C-Program of Task 6

-  Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line using the putchar function ONLY twice (Variable type char was not used)

### C-Program of Task 7

- Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using the putchar function ONLY twice

### C-Program of Task 8

- Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line using ONLY the putchar function three times. 

### C-Program of Task 9

- Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
- Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space
- Numbers are printed in ascending order
- The putchar function is ONLY used four times maximum in the code
- Variable of type **char** is not used

### C-Program of Task 10
Prints all possible different combinations of two digits
- Numbers are separated by a comma, followed by a space
- The two digits are different
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The putchar function was ONLY used five times maximum in the code	
- Variable of type char was not used

## C-Program of Task 11
Prints all possible different combinations of three digits
- Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space
- The three digits are different
- 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
- Print only the smallest combination of three digits
- Numbers are printed in ascending order, with three digits
- The putchar function is ONLY used six times maximum in the code
- Variable of type char is not used

## C-Program of Task 12
Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers
- The numbers range from 0 to 99
- The two numbers are separated by a space
- All numbers are printed with two digits
- The combination of numbers separated by a comma, followed by a space
- The combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order
- 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
- The putchar function is ONLY used eight times maximum in the code
- Variable of type **char** is not used

## Conclusion
Variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops are fundamental building blocks in C programming. Variables allow storage and manipulation of data, while if statements enable decision-making based on conditions. Else statements provide alternative code paths, and while loops allow for repetitive execution until a condition is no longer true. These constructs are essential for controlling the flow of a program, making decisions, and performing iterative tasks. This project gave me an in-depth understanding on these concepts which lays a strong foundation for writing powerful and efficient C programs.
