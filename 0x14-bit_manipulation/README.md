# Project Title: Bit Manipulation in C (0x14-bit_manipulation)

## Introduction

Bit manipulation in C involves performing operations on individual bits of a binary number using bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>). These operators allows manipulation and extraction specific bits and perform logical operations on individual bits.

**Common Bitwise Operators Used in C**

1. Bitwise AND (&): Performs a logical AND operation between two bits. It returns 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
2. Bitwise OR (|): Performs a logical OR operation between two bits. It returns 1 if either of the bits is 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
3. Bitwise XOR (^): Performs an exclusive OR operation between two bits. It returns 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
4. Bitwise NOT (~): Flips the bits, i.e., changes 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.
5. Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions. It effectively multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.
6. Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions. It effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift.

**Relevance of Bit Manipulation**

- Performing efficient mathematical operations, such as multiplication or division by powers of 2.
- Manipulating flags or individual options in a bit field.
- Setting or clearing specific bits in a number.
- Extracting specific bits from a number.
