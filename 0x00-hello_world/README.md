# Project: 0x00. C - Hello, World

## Introduction
:wave: Bienvenue and welcome to my first C programming project with ALX Software Engineering School! In this project, my goal is to 
leverage the tools and concepts taught by ALX, to develop a functional program that showcases my understanding of C programming fundamentals. Throughout this project, I will be implementing key features and adhering to a timeline to achieve my desired outcomes. I'm so excited to embark on this learning journey and showcase my progress in C programming. Let's dive in and make it happen!:relaxed:

## Overview
Welcome to the world of C programming! This project serves as an introductory guide to the fundamental concepts of the C programming language. This project gives a solid understanding of the basic syntax, structure, and workflow involved in C programming. The content of this project includes: Writing bash scripts that execute the C compilation process (Preprocessor, Compilation, Assembly, and Linking) and printing text to the standard output.

## Description of Project Task
The following are descriptions of each task in the project:

### 0. Preprocessor
The preprocessor is a step in the C compilation process that performs text manipulation on the source code before it is passed to the compiler. It is responsible for handling preprocessor directives, such as including header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and other preprocessing operations.

This task involves writing a bash script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file
- The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output is saved in the file c

### 1. Compiler
The compiler checks the source code for errors and translates it into an executable form, such as an object file or an executable file, which can be run on the target platform or operating system.

This task involves writing a bash script that compiles a C file but does not link it
- The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c

### 2. Assembler
The assembler reads the assembly code, converts it into binary machine instructions, and generates an object file that can be linked and executed.

This task involves writing a bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file
- The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

### 3. Name

This task involves writing a bash script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
- The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE

### 4. Hello, puts

The C program of this task prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line
- The puts function is used
- The printf function is not allowed to be used for thi stask
- The program ends with the value 0

### 5. Hello, printf

The C program of this task prints exactly: with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line.
- The printf function is used
- The program ends with the value 0
- The program compiles without warning when using the gcc option: -Wall 

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

The C program of this task prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
In this program, warnings are allowed and the program ends with the value 0.

### 7. Intel

The bash script of this task generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
- The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE.
- The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

### 8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity

The C-program of this prints exactly: and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
- The functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts are not used
- The program returns 1
- The program compiles without any warnings when using the gcc option: -Wall

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to C programming through the creation of the C programs and implementation of C compilation steps. It serves as an excellent foundation for further exploration of the C language and prepares us for more complex programming tasks.
